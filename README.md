### Introduction

In this assignment, two functions have been created to get the inverse of a matrix.



### makeCacheMatrix: 


The first function  creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

The function, "makeCacheMatrix" creates a special "matrix", which is  a list of function 


1.  set the value of the matrix : set()

2.  get the value of the matrix : get()

3.  set the value of the inverse matrix : setsolve() 

4.  get the value of the inverse matrix : getsolve()





###cacheSolve 

This second function  computes the inverse of the special "matrix" using "solve" function 
returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
then cacheSolve  retrieve the inverse from the cache.
